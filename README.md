# **Template Engine - Employee Summary**

This is a Node CLI app that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

## Description

This application will prompt a user for information about the team manager and then information about team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

## Usage
Use this application when you need to add an employee to your program.   [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14vSCg4P-FIgnjmqJm85uwd_9bgPRV5T3/view?usp=sharing "Link to video showing how to use this app") is a short video showing how to use this application.
